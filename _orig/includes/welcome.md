## Welcome to the home of the Open Science MOOC!

This website is aimed to provide information about our MOOC on Open Science principles and practices, its rationale, the current state of the project, and the [people](https://opensciencemooc.github.io/site/People/) behind it.

CURRENT STATUS: **IN DEVELOPMENT**

The first draft of [Module 5](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-5-Open-Research-Software-and-Open-Source/tree/master/content_development) has been completed and awaiting feedback from the wider community (including you!)

<br/>

This project was started in early 2017 after a barcamp at the Open Science Conference in Berlin. Soon, more than 30 people contributed and a first draft curriculum was made. Now, already more than 100 volunteers have agreed to share their knowledge about Open Science and to contribute to what they see as an extremely important issue in nowadays and future science. Concomitantly, the European Commission published its report [Providing researchers with the skills and competencies they need to practice Open Science](https://cdn1.euraxess.org/sites/default/files/policy_library/ec-rtd_os_skills_report_final_complete_2207_1.pdf), supporting the importance of the topic and thereby the necessity to explain, teach and support researchers to gain the necessary skills.

<br/>

We are excited by the support we got so far and we would like to invite everybody to [create, comment, contribute and share](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC)!
